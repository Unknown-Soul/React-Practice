1. Type of Exports in java (named and default Exports)
2. 
Use of ClassName instead of class
Fragments - <></>
Map Method - rendering list using Map -  use map instead of for loop in react
Key Props -  provide unique key to optimize rendering
Conditional Rendering
Passing Data via Props
Css Modules - localised classNames to avoid gloabal nameConflict - name Convention of file {sameNameAsJsxFile}.module.css . cass module add unique name infoent of our class name at time of comilation
Passing Children - children is by default argument that passed on to children
EventHandling -  uses CamelCase like onClick.

State-Management - State represent data that changes overtime. It changes bcz component re-render. Its local and private to a component
                 - useStateHook - repaint whole component
                 - deconstruct object = {}
                 - deconstruct array  = []
                 - hooks can only be used insite component
                 - state change cuase component rerender
                 - for functional components use useStateHook
State and Props :  State is local and mutable, intit inside component, can change overtime and cause re-render, manage using useState in functional components.
                   props passed into component from parent, immutable,allow paren - to -child component
child-to-parent-communication : happens using event. function passed by parents to child
react-icons
reac-developer-tool
react-form
2 way binding (input update state and state update input) 8:07
Use Ref -  Hook to access dom element and retain mutable value without re-render
 
Hooks-
useState
useRef - can store value temp but may not necessarly repaint the component.Retain mutable value without re-render
spread Operator and functional spread operator
Context API - states wich shared among many component we save state in seprate file called context file. context api solve issue of  prop drilling
we use context only in very limited manner as whenver context changes its repaint whole app :Note
Context Hook =  hook to use to use data stored in context API
USe Reducer - complex State -  kind of hook - 2 components -seprate the action and stateManagement. app not consider about statemanagemen
user Reducer is a Hook to help us manage complex logic  -  2 component  Reduer and action
intigrating API
Fetch, Promise
useEffect Hook - handle effects like event listner and data fetching
               - run after every render
               - we pass 2 paramter one action second is dependecny on chnage of which action take place or dependecy is empty

--------------Very Advance TOPICS--------
useCallBack Hook
useMemo Hook 
use Custom Hook
--------------------------------------
fetching data from server
routers- npm install react-router-dom
router-link = use to at place href and at place of <a> use <Link>
use Navigate =  hook to automatically redirect or navigate
fetching and submitting data using react router
fetching data using router through loader
submmit data using router through action
---------------Redux-------------------
Local Component State - useState, ReducerState
Cross Component State - useState with propDrilling
App Wide State - can be used for authantication, theme, userInformation, 
Redux - use to maintin App Wide State
Why use Redux over react context +  hooks
Setup and Coding is tought especially is we have multiple context providers
perfromnace is slow, context should only be used for this that rarely changed

How Redux Works
Single source : use single central store to maintain entire state
Actions :  comopnent never directly changes , Changes through dispatch actions, which 
           descive event.
Reducers: Actions are processed by reducers pure funtion tjam return new state
Immutable : every change return new state
different from useReducer

-------css---

what are block element
what is flex

---Redux--
stateManagement  for cross component and app-wide 
app-wide statement -  theme, autantication etc. we can use useContext or useSSTate with propDrilling 
Redux is optimization of app-wide statemangement
Redux is centeral store
perfromance is slow react-context and complexity increase with project for react-context. Context should only be used where our state changes less freequently
Redux store all the states in key value pair in centeral object from store.
any UI that need to use the state must subscribe to the store and any changes in the object will be notified to the UI
any action on UI need to be in form of dispatch a Action that pass 2 values of reducer one current and one new
